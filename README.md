# Desktop GifDisplay üñ•Ô∏è

Due to the growing trend of "Konata Desktop Dancing", we decided to introduce our own application which is modeled on the original application from 2010 üî•

## Basic information

This application displays a transparent window with a gif that you can freely move around the entire screen, it also has the option of adjusting the size and adding your own gif or music ‚ö°

We used Java 11 here, so no one should have any problems running this application

However, if you need Java 11, install it here: [Java 11 Install](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk11-archive-downloads.html)
